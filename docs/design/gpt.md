Proposed System Design: Async Multi-Camera RTSP Recorder
Using the above insights, we can outline a system design and requirements for a Rust-based application that records synchronized videos and images from a group of PoE IP cameras on a local network. The goal is a robust, efficient, and idiomatic Rust system that meets the needs of an NVR (Network Video Recorder) with multiple cameras.
1. System Overview and Requirements
Functionality: The system will connect to multiple IP cameras over RTSP (each camera provides an RTSP URI for its stream) and continuously record their video feeds. It should also be capable of capturing still images (snapshots) from these cameras either periodically or on-demand. All recorded videos should contain timing information that allows them to be synchronized across cameras during playback or analysis. The system runs on a local network (cameras are PoE, connected via Ethernet) and assumes relatively stable connectivity.
Robustness: It must run 24/7 reliably, recovering gracefully from interruptions. If a camera or network goes down, the system should log the issue, attempt reconnection, and not crash the entire application. Resource usage should be controlled (avoid memory leaks or unbounded growth if a camera is offline). The system should also handle storage management (prevent filling the disk by implementing retention policies).
Performance Efficiency: Use minimal CPU when just recording (no transcoding of video). Leverage camera’s native encoding (typically H.264/H.265) and save that directly. Use asynchronous I/O so that waiting on one camera’s data doesn’t block others. If images need to be captured via decoding, do so sparingly or using hardware capabilities to avoid high CPU load.
Idiomatic Rust Design: The code should emphasize safety and clarity. Use well-established crates (Tokio, Serde, etc.) and patterns (traits, error handling with Result, logging with tracing or log). Concurrency issues should be handled via Rust’s ownership and sync primitives (e.g. each camera’s data is owned by its task, communication via channels, etc.), avoiding data races. Where low-level FFI is needed (e.g. FFmpeg), encapsulate it in a safe abstraction.
Configurability: Users/admins configure the system via a YAML or TOML configuration file – specifying camera addresses, credentials, and recording settings. This file can also include global settings (e.g., the directory for recordings, file rotation policy, log level). Avoid requiring code changes for adding a new camera; it should be as simple as editing the config.
Control Interface: Provide a command-line interface (CLI) to start/stop the recorder and possibly trigger certain actions. This can be a single binary with subcommands (e.g., record start, record stop, record snapshot --cam <name>). This CLI will read the config file and initiate the appropriate behavior. In addition, consider exposing a web dashboard or API in the future (for status monitoring), but the initial scope can rely on CLI and log outputs for simplicity.
2. Architecture and Components
The system will be structured into several components:
Configuration Loader: At startup, the application reads a YAML/TOML file (e.g., config.yaml) using Serde. This file defines a list of cameras and settings. For example, a YAML config might look like:
yaml
Copy
Edit
cameras:
  - name: "Cam1"
    url: "rtsp://192.168.1.10:554/stream1"
    username: "admin"
    password: "password"
  - name: "Cam2"
    url: "rtsp://192.168.1.11:554/stream1"
    username: "admin"
    password: "password"
output:
  directory: "/mnt/videos"
  segment_duration_sec: 3600    # rotate files every hour
  max_storage_gb: 200           # keep at most 200 GB of video per camera
This structured approach is inspired by projects like Oddity and Neolink, which use YAML/TOML to describe camera sources
github.com
github.com
. The loader will validate the config (e.g., ensure URLs are provided, parse durations, etc.) and produce an in-memory configuration struct.
CLI & Application Entry: Using the Clap crate, the application will define commands such as start (to begin recording all configured cameras), snapshot <cam> (to grab a snapshot from a specific camera), and perhaps stop (if we plan to run the recorder as a daemon that can be halted via CLI signal). For example, running myrecorder start -c config.yaml will load the config and then spawn the recording tasks. This design follows Neolink’s approach of subcommands for different actions
github.com
github.com
. If implemented as a long-running service, start would likely be the primary command, and others could connect to a running instance (for simplicity, initial implementation might not include a complex IPC for stop, relying on Ctrl+C or systemd to stop the service).
Camera Session Tasks: For each camera in the config, the system spawns an async task (using Tokio) that manages that camera’s RTSP session. This camera task will perform the following sub-components internally:
RTSP Client Connection: Use the retina crate (or a similar RTSP client library) to set up the connection. This involves sending RTSP DESCRIBE/SETUP/PLAY requests to the camera and negotiating an RTP stream. retina can handle authentication (basic/digest) as needed
github.com
 and will manage the low-level socket communication. By using retina in Tokio mode, the camera task essentially awaits frames from the stream asynchronously
github.com
. If retina is unavailable or insufficient for a particular camera, an alternative is to spawn an FFmpeg subprocess or use rust-ffmpeg to open the stream; however, the primary design assumes retina covers the common cases (H264/H265 streams).
Data Handling (RTP to Video File): As video packets arrive, they need to be written to a file. Since we want to avoid transcoding for efficiency, the system will mux the packets into an MP4 container directly. There are a few ways to do this:
Utilize retina’s built-in MP4 example logic (if available) to create an .mp4 file from the stream. In the retina examples, running the mp4 command will write an RTSP stream to an MP4 file
github.com
. Under the hood, this likely uses the captured H264 NAL units and wraps them into MP4 with proper framing and indices.
Use a crate like mp4 or mp4mux to manually mux H264 frames. Alternatively, leverage ffmpeg via rust-ffmpeg to create a new MP4 file and feed it packets (this could be done in a separate thread for safety; however, using retina + a pure Rust muxer is preferable to keep things idiomatic and avoid complex FFI).
Each camera task will create/open an output file (or segment). It will write to it incrementally as packets come in. If writing to disk is slower than the frame rate, a small buffer can be introduced (e.g., accumulate a few frames in memory); however, since we are mostly performing file writes of already-encoded data, disk I/O should keep up in normal conditions. The writes should be done asynchronously (Tokio’s File allows async writes, or one can use a blocking thread for file I/O if needed).
Segmentation & Rotation: To meet the requirement of long-term recording without filling the disk, the camera task will implement file rotation. For example, it can start a new file every hour (as configured by segment_duration_sec). When a segment duration elapses, the current file is finalized/closed and a new file is created for the next hour. The naming convention might include camera name and timestamp (e.g., Cam1_2025-05-12_10-00-00.mp4 for a segment). A background task or the camera task itself will also monitor the total size of stored files and delete the oldest files if the size exceeds max_storage_gb (similar to the simple recorder which deletes oldest segments to maintain a size cap
lib.rs
). This ensures bounded storage use, a key aspect of robustness.
Timing Metadata: To enable multi-camera synchronization, the camera task will log timing info. Following retina-record’s model, the task can embed timing data in the video stream: e.g., writing SEI messages that contain the camera’s RTP timestamp and the recorder’s local timestamp
github.com
. If using retina, we get access to the RTP timestamps of frames and RTCP sender reports (which carry NTP time)
github.com
. We can use the retina::Clock or similar API to retrieve these. The design will include these in the recorded file. If embedding is complex to implement, an alternative is writing a parallel .json or .csv file for each video segment that lists timestamps for frames. However, embedding in the MP4 is cleaner and keeps video+metadata in one file (viewers could ignore the SEI, but a custom tool could parse it). This approach is proven by retina-record (which uses SEI in H264 track for this purpose)
github.com
. The requirement is that for any given frame or video segment, we can line up Cam1’s timeline with Cam2’s timeline accurately.
Error Handling & Reconnection: Each camera task will run in a loop that is resilient to errors. If the RTSP connection drops or an error occurs (e.g., camera not reachable), the task should catch the error, log it, and retry after a brief backoff. For example, wait 5 seconds and attempt to reconnect. This loop continues indefinitely so that temporary outages don’t require manual intervention. To avoid tight spam in logs, an exponential backoff or fixed delay between retries is used. Additionally, if a camera repeatedly fails, the system could escalate (e.g., send a notification or dump a warning) – but base functionality is to keep trying. Importantly, a failure in one camera’s task must not crash the whole program; other camera tasks should continue unaffected. Using separate async tasks (and not propagating an error unless it’s fatal) ensures isolation.
Image Capture Mechanism: The system will support capturing still images from cameras. There are a couple of modes to design:
On-Demand Snapshots (CLI-triggered): If the user runs myrecorder snapshot --cam Cam1, the system will fetch a current frame from that camera and save it (e.g., as a JPEG file). Implementation: if the camera provides a JPEG snapshot URL (many IP cams do, e.g. http://cam-ip/image.jpg), the simplest method is to perform an HTTP GET to that URL (perhaps using reqwest) and save the response bytes as an image. This can be done outside the RTSP pipeline and will use the camera’s built-in JPEG encoder. If such an endpoint is not available, we can leverage the existing RTSP feed: since the camera task is already receiving video, the snapshot command could signal the camera task to dump the next available frame. For example, we could have a channel where the snapshot request is sent to the camera task, which then grabs the most recent frame data it has (or grabs a fresh keyframe) and writes it to a file. If the video is H264, we’d need to decode one frame to JPEG. This is where using FFmpeg or video-rs might come in: we could use video-rs to decode the frame to raw pixels and then encode PNG/JPEG (Rust’s image crate can encode raw RGB to PNG/JPEG easily). Decoding a single frame occasionally is not too heavy, but doing it in pure Rust might involve unsafe bindings. Given efficiency is a concern, the design might favor using camera’s snapshot API if available. In either case, the snapshot logic will be implemented in a way that doesn’t disrupt the ongoing recording (e.g., it could clone the compressed frame data and process it separately so the recording loop isn’t blocked).
Periodic Snapshots: If a requirement is to capture images at intervals (say, one frame every minute for a timelapse or preview), the system can have a scheduler task that triggers snapshot captures periodically for each camera. This would effectively be an automated version of the above on-demand process. Care should be taken to not overwhelm the camera or CPU; the interval should be configurable.
Storage and File Management: All video files and images will be stored in a designated output directory (configurable). Within that directory, a common structure is to have subfolders per camera (e.g., videos/Cam1/, videos/Cam2/ for organization). The system should ensure that file writes are reliable – using atomic renames if needed when finishing a file, and not leaving partial files in case of crashes (though a crash during recording will naturally leave the current file incomplete; on restart a new file will start, and the incomplete one can be flagged or handled manually). A background maintenance task could periodically scan the output directories to enforce retention policies: e.g., delete files older than X days or when total size exceeds limit, as configured. This can also be done simply at the end of writing each new segment (delete oldest if over limit). This maintenance approach is seen in simple-network-video-recorder which never lets total size exceed a threshold
lib.rs
.
Logging and Monitoring: Integrate tracing or env_logger to log important events – connections, errors, file rotations, etc. Each camera task can prefix logs with the camera name for clarity. For example: “Cam1: connected and recording”, “Cam1: connection lost, retrying in 5s”, “Cam1: segment 2025-05-12_1000.mp4 saved (3600s)”. The logs can be directed to console or a file. For monitoring, the system could in the future expose a tiny HTTP server that serves status (list of cameras and whether they’re recording, current segment file, etc.), but initially logs and CLI feedback may suffice.
Synchronization and Clock Considerations: To truly synchronize multiple cameras, it’s recommended all cameras use a common time reference (e.g., have them all sync to an NTP server). Our system design can’t enforce camera clocks, but we can document this as a best practice. The recorded videos will contain timing metadata as discussed, which is the system’s way of preserving sync information
github.com
. When playing back, a custom tool or script can read these timestamps to align frames from different videos (for instance, to display side-by-side or to feed into a multi-camera analysis algorithm). We ensure that the recorder’s PC clock is also NTP-synced (since we record receive timestamps). Given that retina-record even logs RTCP sender report NTP timestamps
github.com
github.com
, our system should do similarly – this gives an absolute timeline reference. In essence, each camera’s timeline can be mapped to real time (UTC) via those NTP timestamps, which then makes synchronizing streams straightforward (align all to UTC). The requirement here is that our system does not discard any of that info; using a library like retina which already surfaces it saves us from implementing the RTCP parsing ourselves.
Concurrency Model: Under the hood, we will run a Tokio runtime. The main thread (after parsing CLI and config) will spawn one task per camera plus perhaps one task for maintenance (deleting old files periodically). These tasks run concurrently. We may also spawn additional tasks for snapshot requests or use oneshots to handle on-demand commands. Communication between tasks can use channels: e.g., a channel from main to each camera task to send control messages (stop, take snapshot, etc.). Each camera task could also send status updates back to a manager if we want to track if it’s alive or any critical error (or simply rely on logging). The number of cameras could be dozens, which Tokio can easily handle on a single OS thread (though it will likely use multiple threads for scheduling). If a camera uses TCP for RTSP/RTP, that network I/O is handled asynchronously by Tokio's reactor. If UDP is used (RTP over UDP), Tokio can also handle UDP sockets asynchronously (with some care for multiplexing). We should be prepared to enable TCP mode by default (since it’s more firewall-friendly and reliable in LAN). The design is inherently scalable: adding more cameras mostly adds more tasks doing similar work.
3. Notable Crates and Technologies
RTSP & Streaming: We will use retina as the core RTSP client library, given its focus on surveillance camera streaming and async support. Retina is proven in Moonfire NVR and supports ONVIF-specific extensions
github.com
, which means it can handle the kind of cameras we have (including any authentication quirks or RTSP protocol edge cases common in cheap IP cams). It also supports both RTP over TCP and UDP
github.com
, which adds flexibility. By using retina, we also indirectly use its dependency rtsp-types for message handling and h264-reader for parsing H264, which are solid, well-tested crates
github.com
. If for some reason retina didn’t support a needed feature (say, a camera with RTSP 2.0 or some unusual transport), we could consider extending it or using an alternate crate. But currently, retina offers the best idiomatic Rust approach to RTSP streaming. Async Runtime: Tokio will be our async runtime. It’s the most widely used, and retina explicitly supports Tokio integration
github.com
. Tokio gives us networking (TCP/UDP) and utilities like timers (for scheduling retries or segment rotations). It also allows spawning blocking tasks (for any heavy disk I/O or frame decoding). Video Container Muxing: To write MP4 files, we might use an existing crate if available. There is a crate mp4 (from mpetrous) or Mozilla’s mp4parse (which is more for reading). If no sufficient pure Rust muxer is found, we can integrate FFmpeg just for muxing via rust-ffmpeg. Another approach is to use video-rs, which provides a safe API for encoding video and could possibly be used to create MP4 files easily
oddity.ai
. video-rs is built on FFmpeg but hides a lot of its complexity. Oddity’s reliance on video-rs
github.com
 suggests it’s a viable choice. For our design, since we aren’t encoding (just muxing), a full dependency on FFmpeg might be avoidable; retina’s example code might effectively contain a small MP4 writer. This detail can be resolved during implementation, but from a design perspective, the key is we will not re-encode video, only repackage it. Image Handling: For any image decoding/encoding, the Rust image crate can encode raw pixels to PNG/JPEG easily. The challenge is obtaining raw pixels from a compressed video frame. If we use camera’s snapshot HTTP, we get a JPEG directly – then we can just write it to disk (maybe verify its timestamp or overlay a watermark if needed, but likely just save it). If we must decode from H264: one could use ffmpeg through video-rs to decode one frame. Another new crate to watch is gstreamer-video which could decode frames via GStreamer; however, including GStreamer might be heavyweight. Given efficiency goals, using the cameras’ own capabilities (RTSP sub-stream or snapshot) is preferred for images. This keeps our Rust code simpler and CPU usage low. Configuration and CLI: Serde (with serde_yaml or toml) will handle config parsing. This yields strong typing for free (e.g., the config file “max_storage_gb” will map to a Rust u64). For CLI, Clap will parse arguments and subcommands. Clap v4 allows deriving a Parser and Subcommand for an enum, making it clean to define commands like Start/Stop/Snapshot. Clap also integrates with Serde easily (e.g., we can have a --config option and then pass the path to Serde). Using Clap ensures the interface is consistent and help messages are auto-generated, which is user-friendly. Logging: We will use the tracing crate (or env_logger with the standard log facade). We saw Oddity uses an env variable to set log levels
github.com
; we can do similarly or allow a config file setting. Each camera could have its own logger target (like “myrecorder::Cam1”) so we can filter logs per camera if needed. This is more of an implementation detail, but crucial for debugging a running system.
4. Concurrency and Synchronization Challenges
The design inherently deals with concurrency (multiple camera tasks). Key considerations include:
Thread Safety: Each camera task mostly deals with its own data (connection, file handle). There is little shared mutable state between tasks – which is intentional to avoid synchronization issues. Shared components might include a global config (read-only after startup) and perhaps a central list of active tasks (to implement a stop-all or status query functionality). Those can be managed with thread-safe structures or by confining their access to the main thread (which coordinates lifecycle).
Synchronization of Tasks: We will implement graceful shutdown by sending a signal to all camera tasks (for example, using a broadcast channel or a shared atomic flag). Each task will periodically check for a shutdown signal (or we use select! on a channel alongside the frame receiving future). This ensures we can cleanly close files and sockets on exit. Rust async makes it straightforward to cancel tasks via dropping their handles as well.
Ordering and Timeliness: Because each camera operates independently, their data arrives at different times. We are not attempting real-time alignment in-memory (which would be necessary for a live multi-cam view). Instead, we’re focusing on record and sync later. Thus, there’s no need to pause one stream to wait for another – each runs as fast as the camera sends data. We just tag the data with timestamps. This greatly simplifies concurrency: tasks don’t really have to coordinate with each other, they just run in parallel. The only place they meet is perhaps in the maintenance logic (when checking total storage used, one camera’s task might delete files that belong to its camera only – we must ensure one camera doesn’t delete another’s files, so likely each camera task manages its own directory).
Resource Contention: Disk I/O is a shared resource if all videos are saved to the same disk. If many cameras write at once, disk throughput could be an issue. In practice, writes will be somewhat staggered (not all cameras produce a packet at the exact same millisecond). Modern disks can handle multiple sequential writes, though they will become non-sequential if interleaved. If performance becomes an issue, one could introduce an intermediate buffering (like each task writes to an in-memory buffer that flushes to disk, smoothing out small writes). However, since video bitrate is moderate (say a few Mbps per stream), even 10 cameras would be tens of Mbps total, which is within the throughput of typical HDD/SSD. We will assume for design that disk can keep up, but note that using an SSD for the database/metadata and possibly a separate disk for raw video might be smart at deployment.
5. Addressing Gaps and Making Design Choices
In building this system, we should be mindful of current ecosystem limitations and make choices that mitigate them:
Completeness of Rust RTSP support: As of 2025, retina is a strong foundation (production-used), but it’s still in development (its status mentions “many missing features”)
github.com
. We anticipate that basic functionality (H264 streaming over RTSP 1.0) is solid. If a needed feature is missing – e.g., ONVIF backchannel audio or RTSP 2.0 – we can likely work around it (for instance, we might not need RTSP 2.0 at all). In worst-case scenarios (camera is not standard RTSP), our design could fall back to using an external tool. For example, some users integrate the widely used rtsp-simple-server (written in Go) or use FFmpeg externally. While that wouldn’t be “pure Rust,” it’s an operational workaround. The preference, however, is to stick to Rust tools to keep things self-contained and avoid glue processes. A design choice might be to clearly separate the stream capturing interface such that if retina had to be swapped out for another implementation (say GStreamer) it could be done with minimal changes. This could be achieved by defining a trait like CameraStream with methods like connect(), next_packet() etc., and having one implementation that wraps retina, another that could wrap FFmpeg, etc. This adds abstraction overhead but could future-proof the system if retina doesn’t handle a case.
Codec support and decoding: Our design intentionally avoids needing to decode video except for snapshots. If in the future someone wanted to, say, record in a different format or overlay timestamps on the video frames, then decoding and re-encoding would be needed. At present, the Rust ecosystem doesn’t have a pure Rust H264 encoder (there are some experimental decoders). Using FFmpeg for that would be necessary, which is doable but complex. By deciding that transcoding is out-of-scope (and unnecessary for our goals), we stay within the strengths of the ecosystem (handling streams and muxing, which are solved). For snapshots or video analysis frames, we can leverage FFmpeg via video-rs just for single-frame decode as needed, which is a limited, contained use of FFI. This is an acceptable trade-off to achieve functionality without writing a decoder from scratch.
Testing and Validation: A challenge in such systems is ensuring compatibility with many camera models. Our design should include testing with different RTSP sources (various brands, resolutions, with/without authentication) to iron out issues. The open-source projects give us confidence – e.g., retina was built to tolerate “broken” cameras by implementing workarounds
github.com
. Nonetheless, we should prepare for some cameras having idiosyncrasies (e.g., requiring a “Keep-Alive” RTSP message periodically, or sending RTCP in a weird way). We’ll incorporate periodic keep-alive: sending an OPTIONS or GET_PARAMETER RTSP request every so often on each connection to keep it alive (retina may handle this internally; if not, we can schedule it). This aligns with best practices (ONVIF recommends keep-alives).
Extensibility: The design lays a solid foundation for recording and basic management. If future requirements include features like motion detection, AI analytics, or remote access to live streams, the architecture can accommodate them. For example, because each camera feed is accessible in code, we could fork the incoming data to an analysis pipeline (perhaps using an async channel: one copy of packets goes to recorder, another to an AI module). Or, we could run a lightweight RTSP or WebRTC server in parallel to serve live feeds (similar to how Moonfire NVR has a live view, or how Oddity’s server redistributes streams). Those are beyond our current scope, but our design choices (like using async and not tying everything to blocking operations) make such additions possible.
Memory and Error Safety: Using Rust’s ownership model, we avoid common pitfalls like segmentation faults or unmanaged memory. Crates like retina and video-rs wrap unsafe code safely (video-rs internally calls FFmpeg but provides safe Rust interfaces
oddity.ai
oddity.ai
). We should still handle errors from those libraries carefully (they return Results which we must check). For long-running robustness, we’ll want to catch any panic (e.g., using std::panic::catch_unwind around each task loop, so one camera task panic doesn’t crash the whole). However, if our code is written correctly and uses .expect only on truly fatal conditions, panics should be rare. Logging any error with context (camera name, what it was doing) is vital for later troubleshooting.
6. Guidance on Key Design Choices
To ensure the system is idiomatic and effective, here are some rationales and guidance for specific choices:
Use Rust async for concurrency: This avoids the complexity of managing thread lifecycles and locking. Tokio’s work-stealing scheduler will efficiently utilize CPU cores for many camera tasks. As a bonus, using async aligns with the design of retina (which can operate in async mode)
github.com
, making integration easier.
Prefer existing crates over custom implementations: We choose retina over implementing RTSP parsing ourselves because it’s extensively tested with real cameras and implements intricate parts of RTSP/RTP (like handling TCP interleaved streams, reordering RTP packets, etc.). Likewise, we use serde for config instead of writing a custom parser, and we use clap for CLI instead of manual std::env argument parsing. This not only saves development time but ensures we get community best-practices (e.g., Clap automatically handles --help formatting following typical UNIX style).
Maintain clear boundaries between components: For example, the camera tasks should not directly delete files for other cameras. Each task manages only its own output directory, and a separate component (or the same task) enforces that directory’s size limit. If a future feature required global decisions (like “delete oldest overall file among all cameras when disk is full”), we could introduce a coordinator that has a view of all file timestamps. Right now, per-camera retention is simpler and avoids cross-talk between tasks.
Logging and Monitoring: Plan from the start how you will observe the system’s behavior. We include logging at key points (connection, disconnection, file start/stop). This will be crucial in practice because headless NVR systems often run unattended, and logs are the first place to look for issues. Using structured logging (with fields like camera name, timestamp) via tracing can help later integrate with log aggregators or just grepping logs by camera name.
Testing in Stages: To build confidence, one can start with a single-camera prototype (record one camera to file, verify the file plays and contains correct timestamp info). Then extend to multiple cameras to test concurrency (e.g., simulate with a couple of real RTSP sources or even use a simulator like ffmpeg -re streaming a test video to a local RTSP server). Also test the retention behavior (fill disk scenario) in a controlled way. Because Rust ensures memory safety, many bugs will be logic-related (e.g., forgetting to close a file, or mis-parsing a config). Writing unit tests for config parsing (feeding sample YAML into the parser) or for timestamp math (ensuring timestamp alignment calculations are correct) will improve reliability.
Ecosystem Watchpoints: Keep an eye on crates like gstreamer-rtsp (if it evolves to have a nicer API, it could be an alternative) and improvements in retina. Also, webrtc-rs is mentioned in retina’s README
github.com
 – if one wanted to expose a browser-viewable live feed, that crate could be used to wrap the RTSP stream into WebRTC. This is outside our current requirements, but knowing the ecosystem helps in making a future-proof design. For now, our system design does not depend on nightly or unstable Rust features; it can be implemented with stable Rust 2021 edition and available crates.
7. Ecosystem Limitations and Mitigations
Despite the robust design, it’s important to acknowledge gaps in the current ecosystem and how we mitigate them:
Lack of Native Decoders/Encoders: If we needed to transcode (which we avoid), we’d have to rely on FFmpeg or GStreamer. The Rust ecosystem is still catching up on high-performance codec implementations. By structuring the system to primarily do muxing (which is much simpler than encoding/decoding), we avoid this gap. If image decoding for snapshots is needed, using FFmpeg via a crate is our plan B – this is acceptable since it’s a small part of the workflow, not the main loop.
RTSP Server for Sync Playback: Our system records and allows offline syncing, but it doesn’t itself provide a multi-cam synchronized playback. Solutions like Frigate or Shinobi (non-Rust) often have a UI to view all cameras simultaneously. Implementing that is non-trivial in Rust right now due to needing a media server or a custom player that reads our timing metadata. However, since we embed standard timestamps and SEI data, any external tool or a custom script can be built to merge the videos. We might write a companion tool in Rust to read two MP4s and produce a combined video – using the timestamp metadata to align them. This is outside the core recording functionality but is an example of a gap: the ecosystem doesn’t have an off-the-shelf “multicam player”. We address it by making sure the data needed for such a feature is captured.
Hardware Integration: PoE cameras typically just use Ethernet and RTSP, which we handle. But if we consider ONVIF PTZ controls or triggering camera relays, we’d need ONVIF or HTTP integrations. Rust ONVIF libraries exist in early form (e.g., Lumeo’s onvif-rs), but they may not cover the full spec. Our design leaves control channels (like Neolink’s subcommands for reboot, LED control
github.com
) as optional. We can implement a few needed ONVIF actions manually (ONVIF being SOAP/XML can even be done with reqwest if we craft the XML). The gap is that a comprehensive ONVIF crate might be incomplete, so we’d target only essential features or shell out to curl for discovery as a temporary measure. This doesn’t impact recording, but it affects the “whole system” picture if we wanted automatic camera discovery. The guidance here is to implement minimal support (like an ONVIF discovery that prints camera IPs) or require the user to supply camera RTSP URLs in config (which we do, avoiding dependency on discovery).
Community and Maintenance: The Rust video ecosystem is evolving – crates like retina are maintained by individuals and might need support. By basing our system on them, we implicitly depend on their upkeep. If a bug is found in retina, we might have to dive in and fix it (which, being Rust, we can do and contribute back). The design should isolate such libraries so that if one becomes unmaintained, we can swap it (e.g., if retina was discontinued, perhaps GStreamer or an improved ffmpeg binding would replace it). Using trait abstractions as mentioned could ease this, but even without that, modularizing the code (e.g., all streaming logic in one module) would localize changes. This is more of a project management concern, but it’s worth noting as part of being “robust” in the long term.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the proposed system takes inspiration from the best practices demonstrated by existing Rust projects and libraries in the video streaming domain. By utilizing retina for RTSP streaming (ensuring compatibility with ONVIF IP cameras and async operation)
github.com
github.com
, and following the example of retina-record in preserving timing data for synchronization
github.com
, we achieve a high-performance multi-camera recorder that is lightweight on CPU and fully capable of aligning multiple video streams in time. The use of async Rust (Tokio) allows handling numerous camera connections concurrently and efficiently, as seen in prior art. Configuration via YAML/TOML and a clear CLI interface make the system user-friendly and easy to integrate into various setups (from a single PC NVR to a distributed deployment), much like how Oddity’s YAML config or Neolink’s CLI facilitate easy deployment

. We have also addressed the gaps in the current ecosystem by planning around them – leveraging FFmpeg-based crates where pure Rust falls short, and avoiding reinventing complex wheels like video codecs. The result is a design for a Rust NVR system that is idiomatic (favoring Rust’s strong points like type safety, async/await, and rich ecosystem crates), robust (able to handle real-world issues like network dropouts and disk limits gracefully), and efficient (no wasted processing, utilizing cameras’ encoded streams directly

). By following this design, a developer can build a modern, reliable multi-camera recording system in Rust that stands on the shoulders of proven projects and patterns. It demonstrates that even traditionally heavy systems like video surveillance can be implemented in a safe, concurrent, and performant way in Rust, benefiting from both low-level control and high-level convenience from the growing Rust multimedia ecosystem.
